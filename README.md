# blue-whale-bes
Our repo for the analysis and writing of the 1st paper planned from our BES small project grant on *the* blue whale soon to adorn Hintze Hall.

The plan is:

1. **CT** to run replicate simulations of the movement model focussing on migratory Vs resident behaviours. Resident behaviours will be run for three "hotspots": high arctic, norway and green
2. **AJ** to create figures of the empirical and simulated data including geographic maps and heatmaps to summarise the multiple time traces for replicate digi-whales.
3. **NC** to make contact with potential editors given the timeframe.
4. **NC** to draft the paper. **_First draft must be done by at least mid-May_**.

**Edit README when paper is more complete - this is more a to do list!**

# Notes from meeting (some replicates what is above but no point in editing needlessly!)

## Analysis

Using movement models to determine which movements best match the blue whale traces. 
Comparing resident and migratory models, from population hotspots, over 1-2 year time scales.

**Clive to run models and collate results - by next Weds**
**Andrew to create code to make basic figures**
**Natalie to provide info on population hotspots, ** 

## Figures

1. Large three panel figure of reisdent versus migratory model with heat maps of maps and traces for X whales (2 panels) and the blue whale trace with annotation
**Andrew to produce code for basic figures**
**Ellen and Natalie to tidy for publication**

2. Possibly second figure of drilled baleen as inset, and whole whale as picture? Or historical pic? Or skip entirely. **Natalie and Ellen**

3. SI - Agent based model flowchart **Clive**

4. SI - All traces figures **Clive plus Andrew code?**

5. Cover image of whale **Natalie to source with Richard's help**

## Writing

1. Paper
Natalie to draft overall paper - by mid May at latest
Clive to provide methods outline - soon.
Use Kate's info for stable isotope sections
2. Cover letter
Speak to various contacts for tips

Things to highlight
1. Lack of understanding at a time when the species was hunted almost to extinction - potentially one of just 100 whales left.
2. high resoltuion behavioural info is still rare esp in N Atlantic
3. mysterious life but most famous whale in the UK. 
4. We can use SI data to ID migrating vs resident pops. Can be used for otehr stuff from whales to seals to sharks.


## Title

Need to brainstorm
Working title: Reconstructing the last known movements of a celebrity whale

## Practical considerations

1. Code
Clive to send Natalie code to tidy and put on GitHub
Andrew to put code on GitHub as he writes it
2. Paper
Natalie to use Markdown and format in LaTeX at last minute

## Admin/Press

- Need to talk to Nature people
- talk to Museum PEG and Press office
- BBC???

## Authorship
Kate, Ellen, Richard = middle authors
Tbd other authors, but joint first or last, and first or last seems sensible.
