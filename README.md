# blue-whale-bes
Our repo for the analysis and writing of the 1st paper planned from our BES small project grant on *the* blue whale soon to adorn Hintze Hall.

The plan is:

1. **CT** to run replicate simulations of the movement model focussing on migratory Vs resident behaviours. Resident behaviours will be run for three "hotspots": high arctic, norway and green
2. **AJ** to create figures of the empirical and simulated data including geographic maps and heatmaps to summarise the multiple time traces for replicate digi-whales.
3. **NM** to make contact with potential editors given the timeframe.
4. **NM** to draft the paper. **_First draft must be done by at least mid-May_**.
