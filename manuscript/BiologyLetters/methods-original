\section{Materials and Methods}

\subsubsection{Stable isotope extractions from baleen}
Baleen was collected from the Natural History Museum, London (specimen NHMUK.1892.3.1.1). 
The baleen plate was cleaned with ethanol to remove surface contaminants such as skin/gum or other lipids that can influence isotopic signals. 
{\raise.17ex\hbox{$\scriptstyle\sim$}}1mg samples of keratin powder were then collected from the plate using a hand-held drill and grinding bit. 
97 samples were taken at 1cm intervals, 0.5cm from the outer edge of the plate, starting at the proximal (gingival) section that contains the most recent tissue. 
We assume that baleen grows at a relatively constant rate, so the samples are equally spaced through time \cite{best1996stable}. 
Carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis was performed simultaneously via continuous-flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry at the University of Southampton SEAPORT Stable Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry Laboratory (Southampton, UK), using a Vario Isotope select elemental analyser, coupled to an Isoprime 100 isotope mass spectrometer. 
Replicates using internal laboratory standards (L-glutamic acid (C), Glutamic acid (CT standard), acetanilide and protein standard OAS) were used for quality control and calibration. 
C:N ratios for samples ranged from 3.28\text{\textperthousand} to 3.72\text{\textperthousand}, well within the acceptable theoretical range for pure keratin ($3.4\pm0.5$) allowing for comparison among samples \cite{hobson1998stable}. 
All data are available from the NHM Data Portal \cite{data-set}.
 
\subsubsection{Time calibrating stable isotope profiles}
Seasonal migrations across isotopic gradients induce cyclical variations in the isotopic composition of baleen, the distance between cycles reflecting growth rates \cite{hobson1998stable,busquets2017estimating}. 
Clear periodicity was evident in $\delta^{15}$N values across the entire baleen plate, and in $\delta^{13}$C values at 70 - 18cm distance from the gingival end of the plate (behavioural phase two). 
We calculated isotopic periodicity within the baleen sample using Fourier Transform analysis \cite{cardona2017temporal} (Supplemental Figure S1), revealing a consistent growth rate of 13.5$cmy^{-1}$ which is remarkably similar to the mean isotope-derived baleen growth rates of $15.5 \pm 2.2cmy^{-1}$ estimated for six recent blue whales from the Californian Pacific \cite{busquets2017estimating}.  
Therefore we dated the youngest baleen sample as 1st March 1891, 24 days prior to the stranding date, 25th March 1891. 
Cross-correlation analysis demonstrated a strong negative covariance between $\delta^{13}$C and $\delta^{15}$N values within behavioural phase two (70cm to 18cm on the baleen plate), but no clear relationship between $\delta^{13}$C and $\delta^{15}$N values during behavioural phase one (the oldest 30cm of the baleen plate, i.e. 100cm - 70cm; Supplemental Figure S2) or the final 500 days of the whale's life (youngest 18cm of the baleen plate; Supplemental Figure S2).
 
\subsubsection{Baseline isotope comparisons}
Isotope-enabled biogeochemical ocean models \cite{magozzi2017using,schmittner2016complementary} were used to characterize the isotopic composition of phytoplankton expected in different potential foraging grounds (Supplemental Figure S3). 
Annual average $\delta^{15}$N POM (particulate organic matter) values were provided by C.J. Somes (\textit{pers.comm}) based on a 5$^{\circ}$ resolution biogeochemical model (Supplemental Figure S3). 
$\delta^{13}$C POM values were simulated at 1$^{\circ}$ and monthly resolution using an isotopic extension to the NEMO-MEDUSA ocean biogeochemical model \cite{magozzi2017using,yool2013medusa}. 
Simulated  $\delta^{15}$N POM values are relatively positive in the northeast Atlantic north of c. 60$^{\circ}$N, and relatively negative in the central and southern North Atlantic. 
Annual average $\delta^{13}$C POM values largely vary with latitude, with more negative values in more northerly regions. 
In the central North Atlantic, $\delta^{13}$C POM values are relatively positive in the west, reflecting warm gulf stream waters (Supplemental Figure S3). 
The isotopic composition of carbon in phytoplankton also varies through seasons as isotopic fractionation of carbon during photosynthesis is strongly influenced by sea surface temperature \cite{magozzi2017using,laws1995dependence}.
Thus temporal variations in $\delta^{13}$C POM values were superimposed on latitudinal gradients. 
The scale and nature of temporal variation in $\delta^{13}$C POM values also varies with latitude, with higher latitude seas showing greater intra-annual variation in $\delta^{13}$C POM values linked to strongly seasonal phytoplankton growth dynamics. 
The model simulations used are forced with decadal climatological data from 2000-2010 \cite{magozzi2017using}. 
We do not draw inferences about location from absolute $\delta^{13}$C values and thus the reduction in oceanic $\delta^{13}$C POM values caused by release of fossil carbon into the atmosphere (Suess effect) does not influence inferences about location or movement. 
Ocean basin scale spatio-temporal differences in $\delta^{13}$C values, largely reflecting relative differences in sea surface temperatures between trophic, temperate and arctic waters, have remained essentially similar over millennial timescales \cite{schmittner2016complementary} therefore we are confident that the Magozzi \textit{et al} \cite{magozzi2017using} model can be applied to interpret historic baleen isotope data.

We therefore used monthly simulated $\delta^{13}$C POM values to simulate the isotopic expression of phytoplankton expected to be encountered by whales exhibiting differing movement behaviours.
Whales feed on krill, not POM. 
Assimilation of carbon into krill tissues will dampen the temporal variability seen in POM, effectively producing a temporal average over the timescale of isotopic turnover within krill. 
We estimate turnover to be complete between four and six months and therefore we resampled the $\delta^{13}$C POM values in each one degree cell to reflect a six month moving average. 
Carbon isotope values are also likely to be fractionated during transfer from plankton to krill as $^{12}$C  is preferentially lost through respiration. 
The degree of such trophic fractionation is unclear, however and we do not draw interpretations based on absolute $\delta^{13}$C values, rather on the relative $\delta^{13}$C  values across the length of the baleen plate.

\subsection{Quantification and statistical analysis}
\subsubsection{Agent-based whale movement model}
We simulated the movement of the whale with the likelihood, direction, and extent of movement influenced by behavioural state, sea surface temperature, water depth, and phytoplankton concentration (as a proxy for zooplankton food availability). 
At each time point and location in the simulations, we extracted time averaged $\delta^{13}$C values from the spatio-temporal model \cite{magozzi2017using} resulting in a range of simulated isotopic profiles for different migration patterns and foraging areas (Figures \ref{fig2}, \ref{fig3}, and Supplemental Figure S4). 
Movement was coded as a set of probabilistic rules. 
The parameters for these were taken from the literature on blue whale behaviour (e.g. \cite{handbook}). 
All terms were expressed as probability distributions, yielding multiple potential movement tracks. 
 
In the models, the likelihood of movement, direction (north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, or southwest) and linear distance of movement are all influenced by the following. 
(i) Behavioural state (migrating north, migrating south, or foraging).
Northerly migrations were possible only in spring, and southerly migrations in autumn. 
Foraging was possible at any time of year, and was triggered when whales encountered high concentrations of plankton.
(ii) Sea surface temperature \cite{yool2013medusa} ($^{\circ}$C). 
When migrating north, whales were more likely to move towards lower temperatures provided they were above the minimum temperature threshold (3$^{\circ}$C); whereas whales migrating south sought warmer waters. 
(iii) Water depth \cite{bathy} (m; extracted via the marmap package in R \cite{marmap}). 
Whales were less likely to move into waters less than 400m deep, and increasingly unlikely to move into even shallower waters. 
(iv) Phytoplankton concentration ($mmolNm^{-3}$, for combined diatom and non-diatom communities \cite{yool2013medusa}). 
This was included as a proxy for zooplankton food availability. 
Whales are more likely to move towards (or remain within) areas of high phytoplankton density, particularly during the foraging behavioural state. 

We simulated the isotopic expression expected for (a) residency in each known hotspot for blue whale sightings or historic hunting grounds in the North Atlantic (Norwegian/Barents Sea, West Ireland, Canaries/Azores and Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and the Cape Verde/Mauritanian upwelling area \cite{mcdonald2006biogeographic,reilly2008balaenoptera,sigurjonsson1995life}; Supplemental Figure S4); (b) seasonal migration between high sub-Arctic latitudes and temperate latitudes around the British Isles and (c) seasonal migration between high latitudes and sub-tropical latitudes. 
Measured tracks can only be replicated by combination of residency and seasonal migration with latitudinal migrations limited to the last four years of simulations.
For a full description of the model and its parameters see Supplemental Methods: Supplemental Figure S5 and Supplemental Table S1. 
We simulated whale movements 1200 times, then excluded simulations where the virtual whale stranded before reaching the 3019 days of the baleen record, leaving 1049 simulations.
For each movement simulation we extracted phytoplankton $\delta^{13}$C values at each time point and location from the models described above \cite{magozzi2017using}. 
We then compared the simulated stable isotope profiles (Figure \ref{fig3}) to the profile of the blue whale (Figure \ref{fig1}).
