Over 50 years since the International Whaling Commission banned the hunting of blue whales (\textit{Balaenoptera musculus}), North Atlantic stocks are still at only X\% of pre-whaling levels.
Conservation efforts are hampered by the scarcity of detailed data on blue whale distribution, behaviour and ecology, for both historical and present-day populations.
Here we use $\delta^{13}C$ stable isotopes from the baleen of the Natural History Museum's iconic blue whale, along with new movement models, to extract high resolution movement behaviour data for an animal that died over 125 years ago. 
We reconstructed the movements of the blue whale over the final years of its life, and show that it migrated rather than remaining resident in the northern Atlantic year round. 
This is the first quantitative evidence of historical migrations in blue whales.
Our new model provides a way to investigate migration across marine vertbrates and highlights the unique opportunities provided by museum collections for inferring past animal movements.

In 1891, a 25m long female blue whale beached off the coast of Wexford in Ireland. 
In 2017, her skeleton will go on display in the Natural History Museum's (NHM) rennovated Hintze Hall, making her the most famous whale in the UK, if not the world. 
Ironically, we know very little about this animal, or the species as a whole. 

Using stable isotpes (more detail) and a novel model of whale movement that incorporates X, Y and Z (see SI) we were able to trace the most likely movement history of the NHM blue whale. The models do this. We compared these to the carbon traces found for the blue whale (Fig 1C)

This basic lack of understanding is even scarier

Whaling was an intense pressure for whales during this period. The first blue whale fisheries began in XXX, but by 1900 fisheries had moved outside the area because stocks were so depleted. Before whaling, blue whale densities in the North Atlantic are estinated at X-X (depending on the methods used), but by 1900 it is likely that only a few hundred whales were left. The NHM blue whale thus represents an individual from a species at the brink of extinction. Blue whales were the first species that humans legislated to save, and represent a big conservation success story, with numbers of some populations appearing to recover to pre whaling levels.

Even today, high resolution behavioural information for large baleen whales (Balaenopteridae), and cetaceans in general, is rare, particularly for populations in the North Atlantic (by contrast, Pacific populations are more extensively studied, and patches of the North Atlantic are well studied, for example off Iceland)

Our findings have implications beyond this individual whale, and beyond cetaceans. Our models allow us  to ID migrating vs resident pops. Can be used for otehr stuff from whales to seals to sharks. immensely valuable.
